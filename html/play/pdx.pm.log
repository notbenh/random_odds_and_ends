(10:52:07 AM) dukeleto: notbenh: good moroning
(10:52:50 AM) ewilhelm: the productivity in the peak is only borrowed from the next day and divided by 4
(10:53:27 AM) gorthx: I wouldn't say "tipsy"
(10:53:52 AM) gorthx: I would say rather "treated SE Ankeny to my rendition of 'Dirty White Boy'"

(11:12:13 AM) gorthx: :D
(11:12:24 AM) gorthx: Schwern has a fireplace, which I've heard is optimal
(11:15:39 AM) rbuels: if your stove has an exhaust hood, oven at 500 will work fine
(11:16:14 AM) dukeleto: i need castiron
(11:16:40 AM) gorthx: dukeleto: four kilts again?
(11:16:41 AM) dukeleto: notbenh: danke. good work on eulerbench last night! i think that feature warrants us to actually start calling it toolbench now
(11:17:07 AM) dukeleto: gorthx: yep! If you ask really nicely on the twitterwebs, maybe they will pose for a picture for you. 
(11:17:40 AM) jhelwig: dukeleto: When are you getting a kilt?
(11:18:07 AM) gorthx: :$

(11:18:44 AM) dukeleto: gorthx: those are the kilt wearers
(11:19:01 AM) dukeleto: gorthx: i will take the pic for you if they agree :)
(11:19:21 AM) dukeleto: gorthx: three of them are in 1 room, hence the OH
(11:19:58 AM) gorthx: LOL!
(11:20:02 AM) gorthx: That's too excellent.
(11:23:03 AM) ewilhelm: but how many true scotsmen?
(11:24:46 AM) gorthx: "true scotsmen" as in "gets stabbed in the knee when helping someone up after he's knocked him down in a fight"?
(11:24:56 AM) rbuels: no, that was an irishman
(11:25:06 AM) gorthx: oh right.
(11:25:14 AM) ewilhelm: going regimental?
(11:25:30 AM) rbuels: so, i just tried to make an omelette in my teflon pan, since the cast iron is down for maintenance.  fail.
(11:25:39 AM) ***gorthx doesn't actually gather stats on that
(11:26:56 AM) ewilhelm: gorthx, you can't count kilts without accounting for how they're worn
(11:27:09 AM) ewilhelm: rbuels, teflon?  THROW IT IN THE LAKE NOW!
(11:30:09 AM) dukeleto: yeah, teflon always scratches after a few years. then it is worthless. I use them to pot plants
(11:55:12 AM) notbenh: dukeleto: your very welcome, it would not be where it is with out everyone's help

(11:55:47 AM) notbenh: ewilhelm: no that is not an invitation I've had enough of your nagging...
(11:56:50 AM) ewilhelm: but I have a whole pile of nag upstairs you ain't even heard yet.
(11:57:18 AM) ewilhelm: just let me know when you want it.  I can deliver or whatever.
(11:57:36 AM) notbenh: ~sigh~ not looking forward to getting that shipment
(12:02:30 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: i think you have a few container ships ...

(04:05:20 PM) ewilhelm: FUUUUUUUCKKK

(04:08:40 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: please stick it in there real good
(04:08:42 PM) dukeleto: i can help
(04:08:52 PM) ewilhelm: sideways should do it
(04:08:59 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: is it because you are using some nonstandard hippy browser?
(04:09:08 PM) ewilhelm: actually openid is rather a shitty way to do things
(04:09:08 PM) ***dukeleto backs up a few feet
(04:09:28 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: openid sucks less than having a different login for every site. i know that
(04:09:53 PM) ewilhelm: yes,  konqueror is definitely "hippy" - if by "hippy" you mean straightedge
(04:10:09 PM) dukeleto: there is free beer at the wherecamp preparty tonight, in case anyone cares. "pony kegs"

(06:15:45 PM) ewilhelm: Ugh. why can't Sub::Install have a short and simple Sub::Install::install($name, sub {...}) ?
(06:16:16 PM) ewilhelm: I want to tell people to use the things that people want me to tell them to use, but ...
(06:17:15 PM) ewilhelm: but then everyone went and read perl best practices and adopted only the bad ideas?
(06:23:50 PM) ewilhelm: 'use subs::sub' which defines subs::sub (&) {bless shift, "subs::sub"}?
(06:24:07 PM) ewilhelm: subs::sub {...}->install("foo::bar");
(06:26:48 PM) confound: Sub::Installer
(06:26:48 PM) purl: i guess Sub::Installer is a funny module
(06:29:37 PM) ewilhelm: Sub::Installer is also a piece of junk

(06:33:16 PM) confound: Sub::Installer is also DO NOT WANT
(06:33:16 PM) purl: okay, confound.
(06:33:17 PM) pdxbot: confound are you saying it would be faster to load every META.json than to load only the ones hit by a grep?
(06:34:11 PM) ewilhelm: confound, but Sub::Install is WE CAN DO BETTER
(06:35:32 PM) confound: write Sub::Install::Tiny
(06:35:44 PM) confound: though Sub::Install is already pretty tiny

(12:16:27 AM) dukeleto: notbenh: the next gordian not with toolbench is passing args to the arbitrary files. first, just being able to pass the exact same arguments to each file run would be really useful. I have a parrot script that generates N digits of pi and takes N as a commandline arg
(12:19:06 AM) dukeleto: notbenh: also, since the runs are done in groups, X runs per interp, in order, if a background process uses some resource during  interpreter foo's runs, it looks like it is slower
(12:19:48 AM) dukeleto: if the runs were spread out in smaler non-uniform chunks, this wouldn't be as noticeable
(12:19:57 AM) dukeleto: just a thought

(12:02:08 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, is this cheatsheet any good?  http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/gitsvn/
(12:04:18 PM) ewilhelm: or, you have suggestions for "I just wanna pretend I'm using svk but it's faster" usage doc?
(12:04:46 PM) jhelwig: ewilhelm: That link is fine, if all you care about is a single SVN branch.
(12:05:07 PM) ewilhelm: sam's guide goes off on fifty tangents about how to launch satellites and commune with aliens
(12:05:17 PM) jhelwig: If you want to be able to work with more than just the trunk branch, you'll need a few more options for the git-svn clone.
(12:05:40 PM) ewilhelm: thanks.  if I get that far I'm probably fucked anyway
(12:08:49 PM) ewilhelm: anything wrong with starting from HEAD?
(12:09:30 PM) jhelwig: Not if you don't care about any of the history.
(12:11:17 PM) ewilhelm: who cares about history?
(12:13:57 PM) ewilhelm: git-svn show-ignore is using the network?
(12:14:26 PM) jhelwig: Possibly. I don't know off hand.
(12:14:44 PM) jhelwig: It's not really a command I run on a regular basis.  Just when setting up a new git-svn clone.
(12:21:22 PM) ewilhelm: sub import {    no strict 'refs'; <-- might as well have a comment "# FUCK YOU. HAVE FUN" there :-/
(12:22:10 PM) ewilhelm: uh... instead I get comments explaining what (caller)[0] means!
(12:23:13 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: because you might not have read perldoc
(12:24:14 PM) ewilhelm: if I wanted to read redundant crap, I would use python
(12:24:43 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: that cheatsheet is ok, but not understanding what is going on with git-svn and just memorizing commands can get you in deep shit pretty quickly. best not to use git-svn if you can help it
(12:25:03 PM) dukeleto: what are you using git svn for?
(12:25:10 PM) dukeleto: some one else's repo or yours?
(12:28:29 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, googlecode
(12:29:46 PM) ewilhelm: "not understanding what is going on" is what you might call "the user abstraction model" and it's the only way anyone can get anything done
(12:30:30 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: let's argue about it
(12:31:15 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: googlecode doesn't tell me if it is your repo or someone elses. do you control that svn repo or is it some other crazy persons?
(12:31:44 PM) ewilhelm: "that's not an argument, it's just contradiction", "no it's not"
(12:32:43 PM) ewilhelm: someone else... I'm trying to pretend I'm using svk, remember?
(12:32:51 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: if you hope to use git-svn, you need to understand git and svn seperately at certain levels to not get in trouble. that is all I am saying. you obviously know svn, but git is still a mystery and then git-svn wraps it in an enigma
(12:32:59 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: gotcha
(12:33:15 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: i have never used svk, but i think i grasp what it does
(12:33:29 PM) ewilhelm: I don't really understand svn, but I've used it for years.
(12:34:10 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: i have a script that mirrors and svn repo into git, including all branches. would that be useful to you?
(12:34:18 PM) dukeleto: s/and svn/an svn/
(12:34:28 PM) ewilhelm: Really, I don't want to know how the git sausage is made.
(12:34:52 PM) ewilhelm: no that's not useful.  I "just" "want" "HEAD" from "trunk"
(12:35:19 PM) ewilhelm: and then I'm going to plod along in a nice sequential fashion and maybe send a patch somewhere at some point
(12:36:03 PM) ewilhelm: I know it's a flying car and shit but I need to go get some groceries mkay?
(12:37:06 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: so you just want to mirror trunk?
(12:37:22 PM) ewilhelm:  git-svn clone -r HEAD https://perlqt4.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PerlQt4/perl qt4.me
(12:37:41 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: my script does that too. you can just turn of branch mirroring
(12:38:51 PM) ewilhelm: when would (caller)[0] be 'if' ?
(12:40:08 PM) ewilhelm: oh shit
(12:40:25 PM) dukeleto: good lord
(12:40:25 PM) purl: Yeah, right.
(12:40:54 PM) ewilhelm: "use if $confidition module => arguments" fuck
(12:41:41 PM) ewilhelm:   my $incaller = (caller)[0]; $incaller = (caller(1))[0] if $incaller eq 'if';
(12:42:05 PM) ewilhelm: but my if.pm uses gosub, so wtf... time to get out the swear bucket

(10:15:26 AM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: just use swig and write your own that are not braindead
(10:19:44 AM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, swig probably cannot handle it
(10:20:01 AM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: you question the force?
(10:20:19 AM) ewilhelm: or at least, it's going to be a fucking huge task.  You want to try it with me?
(10:20:43 AM) ewilhelm: there are 17k methods in 199 classes
(10:21:03 AM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: i will give you the occasional tip, but I don't really care about qt
(10:21:17 AM) dukeleto: sad but tru
(10:21:43 AM) ewilhelm: it is looking like I have to start from zero though.  The qt3 bindings were GPL and that means nobody can use Qt at work.
(10:21:46 AM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: you can steal all my scaffolding from math::gsl
(10:22:05 AM) ewilhelm: even if they had a trolltech license, they would have been unable to write non-gpl internal apps in perl
(10:22:14 AM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: your $work ?

(04:35:41 PM) jhelwig: 5.8+ is a reasonable requirement.

(11:13:45 AM) ***theory goes back to emacs

(11:22:42 AM) theory: to recompile your Perl as a 32-bit binary.

(06:07:39 PM) duckyd: heh.  Yes, not only are opposable digits awesome, but having two extremties which feature them is key too
(06:08:34 PM) duckyd: so you were just sitting around, cutting thumbs last night?
(06:09:48 PM) ewilhelm: i dunno.  I wonder if detaching the injured digit while it heals would be better than trying not to get it wet/dirty/wedged

(11:04:11 AM) selenamarie: are you on tripit or something? can we share details? 
(11:04:36 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: should I be on tripit? is it useful?
(11:04:59 AM) selenamarie: dukeleto: it's really only useful for sharing stuff and sending you reminder emails when you forget where it was you were supposed to be flying to that week.
(11:05:02 AM) selenamarie: (has happened)
(11:05:11 AM) theory: dukeleto: If you forward a confirmation email to tripit, it will parse it perfectly.
(11:05:21 AM) selenamarie: mostly, i wanted to see if we could carpool to the hotel 'n' stuff
(11:05:25 AM) theory: there's also dopplr, though.
(11:05:28 AM) dukeleto: theory: that is cool
(11:05:58 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i have a slightly odd trip planned, but I will share info with ya

(11:07:30 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: how do I add you on tripit?

(11:13:45 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: he is on the fence. he is invited, but funding/rooms is still iffy
(11:14:18 AM) selenamarie: dukeleto: bummer! tell him we are bringing the scotch.
(11:19:30 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i just invited you on tripit

(11:21:07 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i need to find the dumb email to forward to them, looking now....
(11:21:19 AM) selenamarie: dukeleto: haha sorry for all the trouble. 
(11:22:30 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i just forwarded them an email from alaska airlines, lets see if it works
(11:23:20 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: no troubles, i think tripit as an addition to linkedin kind of makes sense. 
(11:30:05 AM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i think it is still going through the tubes. perhaps the dump truck got a flat
(11:30:37 AM) dukeleto: We received your email (Subject Line: Fwd: Your Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air Trip) but had a problem processing it. This typically happens when your email is not from one of our currently supported booking sites.

(12:08:27 PM) dukeleto: indeed
(12:08:49 PM) ewilhelm: selenamarie, you do technical stuff?  really, like not just baking or what?
(12:08:59 PM) selenamarie: all i do is bake, clean house, and make babies.
(12:09:13 PM) ewilhelm: babies are real technical I hear
(12:09:19 PM) selenamarie: lots of moving parts.
(12:09:46 PM) soh: babies are super technical, but there are many layers of abstraction
(12:09:58 PM) ewilhelm: how did someone like that even get into the mentor summit?
(12:10:20 PM) selenamarie: ewilhelm: i dunno, it was weird. 
(12:10:35 PM) selenamarie: i think because i was wearing stylish shoes, and did not wear a nerd tshirt, i got asked that question.
(12:11:57 PM) ewilhelm: you need more tape on your glasses
(12:12:11 PM) confound: selenamarie: wait, what?
(12:12:11 PM) purl: yeah, seriously
(12:12:35 PM) selenamarie: confound: oh, i'm just kvetching about silly social stuff. some dude asked me how technical i was.
(12:12:37 PM) confound: selenamarie: "how technical are you"?
(12:12:40 PM) confound: huh
(12:12:45 PM) selenamarie: yes, those exact words were uttered :D
(12:12:47 PM) confound: what did you say?
(12:12:47 PM) purl: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what I actually said is, *gets megaphone* HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LICK MY BALLS
(12:12:49 PM) selenamarie: i didn't know what to say.
(12:12:50 PM) selenamarie: LOL
(12:12:54 PM) confound: purl is helpful
(12:12:55 PM) ewilhelm: they thought you were just there with your boyfriend?

(12:13:49 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: who asked you that?

(12:13:54 PM) gorthx: selenamarie:  I think purl's got the right idea.  Esp the megaphone usage.
(12:13:59 PM) gorthx: ewilhelm:  OMG.
(12:14:07 PM) dukeleto: that may be the funniest thing purl has said in a while
(12:14:17 PM) selenamarie: yes. that was pretty funny.
(12:14:30 PM) ewilhelm: gorthx, well, when you put it THAT way, maybe not...
(12:14:33 PM) selenamarie: dukeleto: oh, i haven't had enough alcohol to name names yet.
(12:14:40 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: gotcha :)
(12:14:47 PM) selenamarie: it wasn't anyone that we know.
(12:14:58 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: was this question asked in a hot tub by any chance?
(12:15:07 PM) selenamarie: dukeleto: HAHA. no it was at breakfast the first day
(12:15:17 PM) selenamarie: some random person sat down next to me and started babbling about his PhD thing
(12:15:32 PM) selenamarie: and i didn't really understand what he was talking about (because it was all gobbledy-gook, to be honest)
(12:15:53 PM) ***gorthx has wanted a megaphone for a while, and this may really push her to get one.
(12:15:56 PM) selenamarie: and so instead of thinking, "Hmm, maybe i'm not explaining myself very well", he went down the road of "oh, she must not know anything about technical things"

(12:17:46 PM) gorthx: hee hee
(12:17:48 PM) selenamarie: maybe that's more of a dude command.
(12:18:02 PM) ***gorthx :highfive: s selenamarie
(12:18:04 PM) ewilhelm: not sure if rebastiality is within bounds here
(12:18:11 PM) gorthx: whoa, now
(12:19:15 PM) ***selenamarie apologizes to the channel
(12:19:22 PM) ***dukeleto writes this down in his notebook
(12:19:35 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: high five on git pull --rebase
(12:19:36 PM) ***gorthx thinks how long it's been since we've had The Furry Discussion (tm) at pdx.pm
(12:19:42 PM) dukeleto: git yank ?
(12:20:05 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, stop playing with the porcelain
(12:20:13 PM) gorthx: dukeleto: another good one for the aliases file.
(12:20:54 PM) dukeleto: if git and svn had furry sex with each other, which animals would they be?
(12:21:05 PM) dukeleto: lets not think about cvs
(12:21:19 PM) selenamarie: or hg? messy.
(12:22:06 PM) gorthx: rcs!
(12:23:04 PM) dukeleto: git-svn must be the product of furry sex. that is the only sane explanation
(12:23:15 PM) gorthx: LOL
(12:25:08 PM) ewilhelm: I think the git usage has caused some brain rot.
(12:26:37 PM) ewilhelm:     SV* autoload = get_sv( "Qt::AutoLoad::AUTOLOAD", TRUE );
(12:28:34 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: i told you autoload makes for unmaintainable code. have fun with that
(12:29:39 PM) ewilhelm: unmaintainable?  this is autoload written in XS which reimplements inheritance in a different package than the one into which $self is blessed
(12:30:05 PM) ewilhelm: oh, and $self is not always included as the first argument to a method
(12:30:27 PM) ewilhelm: like doing:  shift->can("whatever")->(@_);
(12:30:56 PM) ewilhelm: but there's a this() function (also XS) which contains your $self!
(12:32:23 PM) ewilhelm: oh, and the XS_AUTOLOAD also calls a perl function to lookup an index, which it then caches in a c++ hash
(12:32:47 PM) ewilhelm: obvious, right?
(12:32:58 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: ruh roh, your OH is being RT'ed, which then gets picked up by OH again. this should be fun
(12:33:09 PM) selenamarie: LOL oh yes.
(12:33:20 PM) selenamarie: i've already seen: "@reidab @selenamarie manpage. That sounds hot."
(12:33:27 PM) selenamarie: and "@selenamarie that's so so wrong! #git"
(12:33:59 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: stop the madness
(12:34:13 PM) selenamarie: this really should be a trending topic.
(12:35:18 PM) dukeleto: selenamarie: i agree. if you tweet something with an already trending topic with that, the spam bots will pick it up..... just sayin' .....
(12:35:29 PM) selenamarie: LOL
(12:36:07 PM) ewilhelm: Rebastiality Anonymous is now following you on Twitter!
(12:36:34 PM) selenamarie: maybe #weightlesswednesday?

(12:40:52 PM) selenamarie: i don't have time!
(12:40:55 PM) selenamarie: someone else needs to
(12:41:43 PM) ewilhelm: is that where you jump off a bridge because twitter told you to?
(12:48:29 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: everyone is doing it
(12:49:07 PM) reidab: something like this should be the twitter background image for @rebastiality

(12:51:33 PM) selenamarie: all caps, too.
(12:51:52 PM) ewilhelm: svn-import kills history and eats babies.
(12:52:04 PM) dukeleto: http://twitter.com/rebastiality doesn't work for me
(12:52:12 PM) dukeleto: lets do it
(12:52:13 PM) selenamarie: wtf people!
(12:52:13 PM) purl: i think people is a person is smart; people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it
(12:52:13 PM) pdxbot: people are making shit up and pasting large swaths of the internals into their build code
(12:52:26 PM) selenamarie: who's gonna pull the trigger? 
(12:52:27 PM) ewilhelm: copy and paste kills history
(12:52:29 PM) dukeleto: we can set it up with cotweet

(12:53:58 PM) ewilhelm: gorthx, you're in a short position on twitter, right?
(12:54:04 PM) gorthx: I agree with ewilhelm that is an appropriate first tweet.
(12:54:06 PM) gorthx: I'm in a what?
(12:54:26 PM) dukeleto: yes, +1 to that being the first tweet. if you can ~@clonezone, that would be even better
(12:55:10 PM) gorthx: ewilhelm:  what does "short position" mean?  Is that a sports reference?
(12:55:28 PM) ewilhelm: stock.  they would, of course, need to go public first.
(12:55:36 PM) dukeleto: Git is like LSD for your version control. You can make people see pretty colors, even if they weren't there.
(12:55:38 PM) ewilhelm: if only I could short them before that...
(12:55:41 PM) dukeleto: gorthx: shorting the stock
(12:56:19 PM) ewilhelm: if I could, we would absolutely have to unleash the catcam on that shit
(12:57:11 PM) ewilhelm: #lickingmybutt would be the #1 trending topic
(12:57:29 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: only in your world
(12:57:43 PM) gorthx: O_o

(01:40:07 PM) dukeleto: indeed
(01:41:53 PM) dukeleto: i think @rebastiality should post FUD about #svn as well, to offset all the FUD about git
(01:42:15 PM) dukeleto: start the FUD machines!

(04:38:58 PM) duckyd: I'm now following.  Soon to regret it?
(04:39:27 PM) dukeleto: duckyd: no, you will enjoy :)
(04:39:44 PM) dukeleto: duckyd: you want in on the cotweet action?

(06:14:11 PM) selenamarie: dukeleto: lolz on the upcoming tweet.
(06:32:44 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, how do I get the equivelant of my @stuff = @_ in XS?
(06:33:18 PM) ewilhelm: equivalent, even
(06:34:04 PM) ewilhelm: sv_mortalcopy()?

(08:39:33 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: are you talking about popping values off the stack in XS?
(08:39:58 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: you want the args to a function in @_ in XS ?
(08:40:44 PM) dukeleto: we are getting backlash already. lulz
(08:41:26 PM) ewilhelm: backlash?
(08:41:26 PM) purl: backlash is funny.  "Yahoo's going to make it suck... because I expect it to make it suck.  I'm deleting my account now.  Love, /.'er"
(08:42:11 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, I ended up making a SV ** mystack = new SV*[items];, then mystack[i] = sv_mortalcopy(ST(wasitems-items+i));
(08:42:29 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: whoa
(08:42:46 PM) ewilhelm: the stack of args was being passed to something that wanted to modify its values in-place, which created "attempt to modify read-only value"
(08:43:14 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, you know a neater way?
(08:48:29 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: there are macros to fiddle with the stack
(08:49:03 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: what you are doing works, but may cause things to go SHITPOCALYPSE in certain edge cases/platforms/cycles of the moon
(08:50:32 PM) ewilhelm: dukeleto, there are macros to copy the entire stack by-value?
(08:50:48 PM) ewilhelm: I am calling ST() you know
(08:50:53 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: see what perlhack and perlapi says
(08:51:08 PM) ewilhelm: they told me to ask you
(08:51:13 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: yes, I see that, but there are also some other macros that you may need to call before and after that code
(08:51:16 PM) dukeleto: fuck me
(08:51:19 PM) dukeleto: who told you to ask me?
(08:51:42 PM) ewilhelm: before and after?  nah
(08:53:04 PM) ewilhelm: wasitems is just a bit about that I had some stuff already off the front of the stack.  would be nice if I could get at the last N (ala having done shift)
(08:53:38 PM) ewilhelm: even the XS declaration (foo, ...) didn't do much for me cause ST(1) is still the start of ...
(09:19:35 PM) ewilhelm: hmm, code changes the second time you call it... back away...
(09:22:50 PM) ewilhelm: oh crap, that was always cached before I started changing things, so probably is something seriously wrong but older than dirt
(09:46:49 PM) dukeleto: ewilhelm: you are in the dark recesses of XS-land
