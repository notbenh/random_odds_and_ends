As for the new timing data, it is collected in aggregate and is for student services to assess how the reality of our courses matches up with our documentation. So this is more of a self assessment for the organization and I never see the value that you supply. Take as much time as you need to solve this one as it is not a factor of your grade in any way. For me it is far more important that you understand and are comfortable with the subject matter. Let me know if there is anything about this that I can help explain.
