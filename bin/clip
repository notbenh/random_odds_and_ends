=head1 USAGE

  $0 [files]

=head1 NOTATION

  Due to dmenu being line focused and I needed multi-line notes there is
  a <<file>> notation where you can include a file in your note and if a
  <<file>> is found then only the content of that file is tossed to xclip.

=head1 INTENT

For all input files toss them to dmenu and then what ever is selected
should go to the pastebin based on xclip.

=head1 TODO

Currently this is stricltly tied to xclip rather then being a bit
more broad by using pb* on a mac or what ever is the correct clipboard
manager for windows
