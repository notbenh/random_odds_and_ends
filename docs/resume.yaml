     discription: As the resident tool builder I was in charge of constructing solutions to allow the rest of the team to be agile and efficient. I am most proud of the construction of a routes based micro web framework written in Moose and served via mod_perl, similar in concept to a Dancer or Sinatra. Other major development has included Google Books integration, schema redesigns, ETL for publisher feeds, rebuild of our search, decision framework used for Online Buy Back, as well as the creation of many other modules to standardize work flow patterns around the office.
